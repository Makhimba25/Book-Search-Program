# Book-Search-Program

* This tool was developed to help organize my personal library of over 200 books.

* The original data set features the Title, Author, Description, Setting, Location and Read status of each book.

* The first part of the program allows me to search for a book by the title. Once typed in, the program returns the location of the book on my bookshelf and other information about the book.

* The second part of the program helps me figure out which book I should read next by asking questions to narrow down my search based on my preferences at the time. 

* As an added bonus, the program also tells me how my books are distributed across genre and which books I have multiple copies of.
